Here I'll list where you can find satisfactory features described in Project 2.

1.
  a) Mysql database located at mysqladmin.  Used to generate dynamic content via concerts.php, and concertPage.php.
  b) Queries found on said pages.

2.
  a) Product ordering forms found on each individual generated concertPage.php
  b) Validation found on all form inputs if a ridiculous submission is made.
      For example, letters for a phone number, or digits for a name.
      If such info is submitted, an alert appears with further instructions.
  c) If valid information is inputted, data is stored in the 'sales' table of my database.

3.
  a) After hitting the 'submit' button on each detail page successfully ,
      the user is redirected to an order confirmation page which is displayed with the details of said order.

4.
  a) 1 ajax feature occurs in the forms located on each individual concert detail page.
      Specifically, the 'email' input will show a selection of email domains the user can choose from.
  b) I did not implement a second ajax feature.
